"""Staleness signals for a project's Claude-context files.

Read-only. The strongest, most reliable signal that an instruction file has gone
stale is a reference that no longer resolves — a path to a file, directory, or
import that has since been renamed, moved, or deleted. That is what this scan
reports. (Time/churn-based signals are deliberately left out: a fresh git clone
resets mtimes, so they produce noise, not signal.)

Reused by both the freshness skill and the SessionStart nudge hook.

Usage:
    python drift.py [--project-root PATH]

Standard library only. Python 3.10+.
