# Changelog

All notable changes to Hestia are documented here. Versions are owned by `plugin.json` in this repo — bump here, not in the marketplace index.

## [1.1.0-beta] — 2026-06-29

### Added — situational and rotating doctrine injection

Doctrine injection is now tailored to the moment instead of repeating one fixed brief, keeping the standing orders loyal across long sessions and context compression. Supersedes the 1.0.6 per-turn micro-nudge (a single fixed line every turn, which a long session learns to discount as boilerplate).

- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — `SessionStart` now matches `startup|resume|clear|compact`, so the brief re-injects after compaction instead of silently dropping out. New `PreToolUse` group fires the companion hook on edit / write / shell / dispatch / web / plan / ask / skill / SQL / build tools.
- **`hooks/companion-inject.py`** — routes five moments. `SessionStart` `source` selects the preamble: `startup`/`clear` get the initial preamble, `resume`/`compact` get a re-anchor preamble (anti-drift framing) while keeping the full order bodies, so a re-brief after compaction never loses detail. `UserPromptSubmit` now emits ONE line picked at random from a rotation pool (instead of the same four-in-one line every turn), so no fixed string is there to tune out. `PreToolUse` injects a situational nudge matched to the tool about to run (JSON-wrapped `additionalContext`), and stays silent for unmatched tools — injection only, never gates the call.
- **`skills/lean/doctrine.md`** — preamble strengthened from descriptive to prescriptive: the orders are instructions in force every response and tool call, off only via `/hestia:lean off`, and "if you are unsure whether an order applies, it does." Adds a re-anchor preamble (`REANCHOR` marker) and a `NUDGES` block holding the rotation + situational lines. Every NUDGES line is an `id`-tagged restatement of an existing order — no rule the order bodies don't already mandate. The now-unused `turn`/`micro` order attributes were removed.

32 companion-hook tests (19 new: re-anchor source routing, turn rotation, PreToolUse JSON contract and silence on unmatched tools); 602 total in the suite.

## [1.0.7-beta] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed — freshness skill false positives in refs.py

Three distinct false-positive classes eliminated from the reference scanner, plus a pre-existing `:line` suffix gap:

- **Class 1 — `./knowledge/...` from `prepare` skill:** `resolve()` now tries project-root-relative as a fallback when `./foo` doesn't exist file-relative. The `prepare` skill example paths are also corrected to bare `knowledge/...` (no `./` prefix), aligning its output with the scanner's project-root-relative convention for bare paths.
- **Class 2 — `references/xxx.md` inside skill subdirs:** `resolve()` now tries file-relative as a fallback when root-relative lookup fails, correctly handling SKILL.md files that cite their own `references/` subfolder.
- **Class 3 — `.../tasks/Foo.kt` prose ellipsis:** `_looks_like_path()` now rejects tokens starting with `...`, preventing prose shorthand from being treated as a broken file reference.
- **Bonus — `:line` suffix stripping:** `resolve()` now strips `:\d+` suffixes before the existence check (e.g. `File.kt:10` → checks `File.kt`). This was a pre-existing gap that masked Class 1.

Adds `tests/test_refs.py` with 21 tests covering all three classes and verifying existing correct behaviours are preserved.

## [1.0.6-beta] — 2026-06-29

### Added — per-turn doctrine re-injection via UserPromptSubmit hook

Hestia now re-anchors its four most actionable standing orders on every user prompt, not just at session start. As context grows long the session brief loses its hold; the per-turn micro-nudge keeps doctrine active throughout.

- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — new `UserPromptSubmit` entry pointing at `companion-inject.py`.
- **`hooks/companion-inject.py`** — new `build_turn_context()` function assembles a single-line micro-nudge from all `turn=yes` orders (`lean`, `truth-grounding`, `scope`, `communication`). New `UserPromptSubmit` branch in `main()` dispatches to it. Attribute parser upgraded to handle quoted values (for `micro="..."`) and hyphenated identifiers (for `id=truth-grounding`).
- **`skills/lean/doctrine.md`** — preamble updated with persistence anchor ("remain active even as context grows long"). Four `ORDER` markers gain `turn=yes micro="..."` attributes.

Per-turn payload (~25 tokens): `[Hestia] Lean: smallest change that fully solves the problem. · Truth-ground: flag niche-tech knowledge gaps before coding. · Scope: park discoveries with hestia:later <what> — revisit when <trigger>. · Communicate: answer first, match their vocabulary, no hedging.`

`off` mode suppresses the nudge. All other verbosity levels produce the same compact payload — the per-turn injection is already at its terse floor.

## [1.0.5-beta] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed — lean doctrine extraction

`scripts/extract.py` now preserves `Memory` and `Formatting` terse forms intact instead of fragmenting them into sub-bullets. Added `tests/test_extract.py` to guard against regressions.

## [1.0.4-beta] — 2026-06-28

### Added — companion communication & formatting orders

Two new always-on standing orders added to `doctrine.md`, with full support across all verbosity levels (`lean`, `trim`, `bare`, `off`) and the injection ledger.

- **Communication:** Lead with the answer, not the reasoning. Match technical depth to the vocabulary the user used. Skip hedging, over-explanation, and jargon the user did not introduce first.
- **Formatting:** Use tables, bullets, headers, and separators when they genuinely reduce scanning effort — comparing options, parallel items, distinct topic shifts. Do not impose structure on a flat answer.

Both orders are `critical=no build=no`: injected in full at `lean`, terse at `trim`, dropped at `bare`, excluded from subagent context (communication style is the orchestrating session's concern, not the subagent's).

`KNOWN_ORDERS` in `scripts/injection_ledger.py` updated to include `communication` and `formatting` so the self-audit ledger can track whether they earn their always-on slot.

## [1.0.3-beta] — 2026-06-28

### Changed — `/hestia:prepare` improvements
- **Migration mode (Step 1):** new mode gate distinguishes fresh terrain from migrating existing Skills that reference machine-specific absolute paths. Migration path scans `.claude/skills/` for hardcoded roots, skips the YAGNI gate, and repoints refs to `./knowledge/<repo>/...` at Step 5.
- **Large-repo guard (Step 3):** before cloning, checks estimated repo size. Over ~500 MB, surfaces a choice — clone shallow, add as git submodule, or skip and rely on docs. Prevents silent multi-GB pulls.
- **Sharper triggers:** `when_to_use` now explicitly names "knowledge folder", "clone repo into project", "my skills have hardcoded paths", "repoint existing skills". Added explicit "Do NOT confuse with `/hestia:primer`" note to prevent misrouting.

### Fixed
- `/hestia:primer` was missing from the README skills table.

### Added
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (`pytest tests/ -v` on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows — Python 3.13).
- `.gitignore` for `__pycache__`, `.hestia/`, `.hestia-tmp/`, test cache.

### Changed — housekeeping
- Hestia moved to its own standalone repo (`V-Songbird/hestia`); monorepo sources it as a git submodule.
- Version ownership moved from `marketplace.json` to this `plugin.json`.
- Marketplace description and keywords tightened.

## [1.0.2-beta] — 2026-06-27

### Changed — sharper lean doctrine (token reduction)
- **Response shape rule:** "one line max — what was skipped and when it matters." Replaces the vague "a few short lines" with a concrete ceiling.
- **No-defense rule:** never explain why you made something simple. The urge to justify a short solution is the bug — cut it.
- **Inline ceiling comments:** `// lean: <what this skips> — upgrade when <trigger>` marks deliberate simplifications at the site in code. Distinct from `hestia:later` (scope drift) — a ceiling comment stays with the code; `hestia:later` parks work the current task doesn't own.

## [1.0.1-beta] — 2026-06-27

### Changed — smarter truth-grounding in `/hestia:prepare`
- **YAGNI gate (Step 4):** before proposing Skills or Rules, prepare now checks whether a real gap exists. If training knowledge plus the gathered sources show no significant gaps, it skips artifact creation and notes the self-assessment is available in conversation — no noise for domains Claude already knows well.
- **Knowledge folder (Step 3):** GitHub repository URLs are now cloned shallow (`git clone --depth 1`) into `./knowledge/<lib-name>/` so the source is navigable on disk. Documentation and non-repo URLs stay as `WebFetch`.
- **Pointer-index Skills (Step 5):** Skills are now authored as pointer-indexes — each entry names a concept, states its constraint in one line, and points to a `./knowledge/<lib>/path:line` location in the cloned source. Claude reads the file directly when it needs depth. Narrative summaries are no longer written, eliminating the telephone-game distortion where source → Claude summary → skill adds two lossy hops.

## [1.0.0-beta] — 2026-06-27

First feature-complete, dogfooded release. All six pillars built, conformed to the official Claude Code spec, and hardened with an evidence-driven epistemics layer. Both interactive flows (`/hestia:checkup`, `/hestia:assess-rules`) were driven end-to-end as a live session — including the human F3/F8 judgment loop — before this promotion.

### Added — epistemics upgrade (evidence-driven)
- Finding contract: cite-or-drop (every finding must point at a `file:line` or it is dropped), triple-shape (symptom / why / fix), honest-limits ("what this run could not check"), counted-facts-only (no fabricated impact %).
- Folklore check: `/hestia:assess-rules` classifies every rule as enforceable / observable / folklore and flags unenforceable rules for rewrite-or-delete.
- Staleness-as-honesty: checkup/freshness derive a fresh/aging/stale label from cheap signals instead of storing a grade; cleared surfaces are recorded so repeat runs skip unchanged inputs.
- Lean + measurable injection: SubagentStart receives only the build-governing standing orders (~30% smaller); a confirm/dispute ledger makes the standing orders self-auditing.
- `hestia:later <what> — revisit when <trigger>`; debt flags trigger-less markers as silent-rot risk.
- Verify-the-detector: every probe has a known-bad fixture proving it fires.

### Changed — spec conformance
- Rules engine now parses rule frontmatter (`paths:` canonical; `globs:` legacy alias), making the F4 load-trigger factor live; recursive discovery of nested rules/commands; `@`-import resolution; `CLAUDE.local.md` and opt-in `~/.claude` user scope.
- Corrected the docs Hestia teaches (the `Setup` hook event, `@`-import depth, `disallowed-tools`, `PreToolUse` enforcement framing); subagent frontmatter keys (`tools:`/`skills:`).
- Curse-of-Knowledge framing for `prepare` + truth-grounding standing order.

### Fixed
- Numerous engine + skill-contract fixes found by an 11-agent docs audit and a live dogfood (the `--build-analysis` mode, `examples.json` regex, drift worktree noise, the `.hestia-tmp` same-directory rule, and more).

### Status
- 561 tests passing; manifest clean. Beta = feature-complete and dogfooded; real-world mileage across diverse projects earns the stable `1.0.0`.

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-06-27

Initial scaffold. Absorbs the planned `virgil` freshness scope into a single setup-health toolbox.

### Added
- Flagship front door: `/hestia:checkup` — prioritized plain-language audit of CLAUDE.md, rules, agents, skills, hooks, commands
- Minimalism pillar: always-on lean doctrine (SessionStart hook), `/hestia:lean` mode control, `/hestia:lean-review`, `/hestia:lean-audit`, `/hestia:debt`
- Freshness watch: SessionStart nudge hook (throttled, signature-based), `/hestia:freshness` full staleness scan
- Rules engine: full 8-factor quality model (F1/F2/F3/F4/F7/F8) — `/hestia:assess-rules`, `/hestia:author-rules`, `/hestia:format-rules`, `/hestia:primer`
- Authoring pillar: `/hestia:scribe` (8-item pre-completion checklist), `proofreader` agent (13-item checklist, read-only), `/hestia:proofread`, `/hestia:run-tests`
- Plugin manifest and marketplace registration.
- Project scaffold: shared script library, setup-discovery module, state/coordination namespaces (`.hestia/`, `.hestia-tmp/`).
- All scripts stdlib-only; Python 3.10+; inter-script JSON contract

### Supersedes
- `virgil` (planned, never shipped) — staleness detection absorbed into freshness pillar

### Notes
- Read-only posture for all audit and watch surfaces; authoring/format skills write only on direct invocation behind approval gates.
- Build is phased — see the project plan for the full task breakdown.
